# Users and sharing

There are two classes of users, admin and data managers.
The initial server configuration includes an administrator role.
This account and password should be immediately changed after installation. See the Developer Guide for more information.

## Roles

Admin accounts can add users, configure the system, and all tasks of data managers.
Data manager accounts can manage data only. They can share data sources and do other matching tasks.
Custom accounts with specific roles may be created in the future.
Please let the community know if you have use cases for custom account roles.

## Self-registration

Administrators may configure the system to allow for anyone to self-register. This is under the Configure System tab. This option is off by default.
